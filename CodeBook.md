This data was attained by cleaning a large data set containing experiments that were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the experimenters captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments was video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

For this data, we merged the train and test sets back together, filtered out only those features corresponding to mean or standard deviation calculations, and took the means of those calculations for each subject and activity.

'Subject' = Number of participant in experiment out of 30
'Activity' = One of 'walking,' 'walking upstairs,' 'walking downstairs,' 'sitting,' 'standing,' or 'laying'
't' or 'f' = signal domain of time or frequency
"Body" or "Gravity" = Body or gravity acceleration signal
"Mag" = magnitude of signal
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
'mean' = Mean value
'std' = Standard deviation
'meanFreq' = Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
